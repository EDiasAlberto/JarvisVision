# Jarvis Vision

## Description

An OpenAI API wrapper that allows for some interaction with local hardware (such as camera and voice interaction). This allows for more user-context specific interaction, such as recognising items in view of the camera or providing assistance more relevant to what the user is looking at. 

## Features

+ Webcam based Vision
+ Copying suggested code segments to clipboard 
+ Microphone input for command
+ Speaker output for Text-To-Speech

## TO DO 

+ Access clipboard to fetch code if user needs help with something specific
+ Access local screen capture to maybe provide user context specific aid
+ Implement button based interaction rather than running a script each time 
+ Implement some form of persistence for memory and setup across reboots
